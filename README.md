# MobileNet pre-trained model in CNN for the binary image classification
### Dataset - Muffin vs Chihuahua, which comes from [Kaggle ]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelcortinhas/muffin-vs-chihuahua-image-classification)).
What's in the project? 
1) python file with CNN, which inclues customed MobileNet pre trained model for the binary image classification. Basically the task of the model was to distinguish were was depicted muffin and where - Chihuahua.
2) two png files (which I forgot to rename -_-), which represent accuraccy and loss during test/ train
3) txt file with results of classification report for the second experiment (overall is all good, sorry for 5 misclassified animals hehe). 

The data was not added cause its too heavy.

I'm leaving pics here as well, cause its the most comforting staff I've seen lately:
